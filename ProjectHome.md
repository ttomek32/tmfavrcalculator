<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>We've got nice and simple GUI for AVR Dude which facilitates AVR programming. No more locked microcontrollers! Easy, and foolproof. Please head over to read all about it, and of course to try out our latest release.<br />Please read our wikipage before issuing the bug.</p>



<br />Please head over below webpages as without these project our one would not exist:
